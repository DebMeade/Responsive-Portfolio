            <p>I’m Debbie, a UX Designer and developer with experience in the Financial and Marketing industries.</p>

            <p>I have worked in the financial industry for over 12 years but I knew something was missing.  I wanted to have some creativity in my job so I decided to change careers and learn UX Design and Web Development.  The skills I have developed for UX Design and Web Development allow me to have the best of both worlds – being analytical as well as creative.</p>
                            
            <p>I was born in Colorado but have lived in a few different states including California where I attended Loyola Marymount University.  I received a degree in Finance and Marketing and although I occasionally miss the beaches I missed Colorado more so I moved back in 2004 and have been enjoying our beautiful state ever since!  In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my dog Scout, horseback riding and traveling.</p>
